##### ****Profiles.vbs:**
    
```
' This example demonstrates the use of profiles. Profiles are set of properties 
' allowing to apply them to Extractor in any combination quickly. You can use 
' predefined profiles or create you own in JSON format like in this example.

' Create Bytescout.PDFExtractor.TextExtractor object
Set extractor = CreateObject("Bytescout.PDFExtractor.TextExtractor")
extractor.RegistrationName = "demo"
extractor.RegistrationKey = "demo"
extractor.OCRLanguageDataFolder = "c:\Program Files\Bytescout PDF Extractor SDK\ocrdata_best"

' Load sample PDF document
extractor.LoadDocumentFromFile("..\..\sample_ocr.pdf")

' Apply predefined profiles
extractor.Profiles = "scanned, no-layout"
' Extract text to file
extractor.SaveTextToFile("result1.txt")


extractor.Reset


' Load another document
extractor.LoadDocumentFromFile("..\..\sample_ocr.pdf")

' Load and apply custom profiles
extractor.LoadProfiles("profiles.json")
extractor.Profiles = "keep-formatting, ocr-forced-200dpi"
' Extract text to file
extractor.SaveTextToFile("result2.txt")

```
